1. Write a program that starts with this vector list of numbers and calculates the following properties (be sure to follow the guidelines for each: 

A. Sum : Add up all of the numbers using a loop. Don’t hardcode things! Someone should be able to add more numbers to the end of this list and your program should still compile and produce the correct result for that
  new list. 
  
B. average : This is the sum divided by the total number of numbers in the list (i.e. the vector), N. To get the size of a vector, try looking into the size() method for vectors (NOTE : we did not explicitly cover this in class, so you’ll need to do some reading of documentation). Again - don’t hardcode! 

C. standard deviation : If you don’t recall, the standard deviation is a measure of the average spread of the
values in a list.


2. Code the Euler project given as: “If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.”

3. Write a piece of code that creates a vector of floats and fills it within a loop. During each iteration of the loop, the user will have to enter commands via the std::cin call that direct the loop to either terminate, and break out of the loop, or proceed to adding another entry onto the vector. If the command is to fill another entry, then the entry should be a random number that is evenly distributed between 0 and 1. After filling this entry onto the vector, print out the entire contents of the vector, including the entry at each spot and its location in memory. Describe how exactly c++ is allocating memory when you create and expand the vector you have created.

4. - BONUS Project Euler

Describe the procedure or algorithm that you would use to solve question 4. Now implement this in code using the same requirements for how you write the code as you did for Question 1 above.

“A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 * 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.”
